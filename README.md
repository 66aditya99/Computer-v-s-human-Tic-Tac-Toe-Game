# Computer-v-s-human-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
It is a computer v/s human tic-tac-toe game build using C++ language. I have used backtracking algorithm called minimax for building the computer engine. The algorithm predicts most optimal move for the engine. 
I challenge you to defeat the engine in a game of tic-tac-toe ðŸ˜‰
